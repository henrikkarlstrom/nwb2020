Description: Funding of Norwegian research institutions is partly tied to the 
scientific publication output of the institution. The so-called 
results-based funding mechanism was originally designed to 
incentivise publishing in top publication channels, but has been 
criticised for giving preference to fields where single-author 
publications are the norm.

In 2015, two changes were introduced: one with the intention to 
increase recognition of contributions to multiple-author publications 
and the other to stimulate increased international co-authorship. 
While this has led to a levelling of funding across scientific 
fields by virtue of the design of the multi-authorship indicator 
it is more uncertain whether the incentive for internationalisation 
has had any noticeable effect. International co-authorship had been 
steadily increasing in the years leading up to the policy change and 
has followed a linear trend since.

This paper uses interrupted time series analysis to estimate the 
effect of the internationalisation component of the funding 
mechanism. The analysis combines trend decomposition with a 
comparative analysis of the international co-authorship trends in 
other Nordic countries which have similar publication funding 
mechanisms but did not introduce an internationalisation modifier 
at the time Norway introduced the change. The result will offer 
insights into the merit of designing highly specific incentives 
for publication activities.
